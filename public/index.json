In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll share some lessons learned from deploying LLM-powered applications at scale.\nThe Reality Check When you\u0026rsquo;re prototyping, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get excited about the capabilities of modern LLMs. But production is a different beast. You need to think about latency, cost, reliability, and security—all while maintaining the quality that makes these models useful in the first place.\nKey Considerations Context Management: The way you structure prompts and manage context windows can make or break your application. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen teams spend months optimizing their RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines because they didn\u0026rsquo;t think through their chunking strategy upfront.\nCost Optimization: Token costs add up fast. Caching strategies, smart batching, and choosing the right model for each task can reduce costs by 10x or more.\nObservability: You need to see what\u0026rsquo;s happening inside your LLM calls. Logging, tracing, and evaluation metrics are essential for debugging and improvement.\nThe Path Forward The LLM landscape is evolving rapidly, but the fundamentals of good software engineering still apply. Start simple, measure everything, and iterate based on real user needs.\nMore details coming in future posts!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:34583/posts/building-production-llm-apps/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLarge Language Models have transformed how we think about AI applications, but building production-ready systems requires more than just an API call to GPT-4.

Turns out, writing is how you figure things out.\nThe Thinking Tool When you sit down to explain a concept in writing, you quickly discover what you actually understand versus what you just thought you understood.

They\u0026rsquo;re not necessarily better communicators—they\u0026rsquo;re better thinkers, and writing is their thinking tool.\nThe Compounding Returns Here\u0026rsquo;s what happens when you write consistently:\nYou learn faster - Forcing yourself to articulate concepts solidifies your understanding You build your reputation - Good writing attracts opportunities You help others - Someone struggling with the exact problem you solved will find your post You create documentation for your future self - I can\u0026rsquo;t count how many times I\u0026rsquo;ve referenced my own blog posts Just Start Don\u0026rsquo;t wait until you\u0026rsquo;re an expert.

But really, I\u0026rsquo;m just someone who gets genuinely excited about solving hard problems and sharing what I learn along the way.\nWhy I Write Writing isn\u0026rsquo;t just a hobby for me—it\u0026rsquo;s my thinking tool. There\u0026rsquo;s something magical about forcing yourself to articulate an idea clearly enough for someone else to understand it. The process of writing exposes the gaps in my knowledge, sharpens my reasoning, and helps me crystallize concepts that otherwise live as fuzzy intuitions in my head.\nKnowledge Should Flow Freely Tech has always thrived on open knowledge sharing. Someone wrote the blog post that helped you debug that weird AWS error. Someone else created the Stack Overflow answer that saved your weekend. I write because I\u0026rsquo;ve been on the receiving end of that generosity countless times, and I want to pay it forward.\nWhether it\u0026rsquo;s architecture patterns for generative AI, lessons from building production LLM systems, or just observations about working in tech, I believe in documenting and sharing the journey. We all level up faster when we share what we learn.\nBeyond the Keyboard When I\u0026rsquo;m not architecting cloud solutions or experimenting with the latest AI models, you\u0026rsquo;ll find me on hiking trails, geeking out over fountain pens, or diving deep into Reformed theology. I\u0026rsquo;m a believer that the best engineers are well-rounded humans with curiosity that extends beyond code.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Connect I\u0026rsquo;m always up for connecting with fellow builders, learners, and knowledge sharers. Find me on LinkedIn where I share insights about AI/ML, cloud architecture, and career growth in tech. Whether you want to chat about model context protocols, swap hiking trail recommendations, or debate the merits of different fountain pen nibs, my inbox is open.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s build something great together.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:34583/about/","summary":"About Vijay Niles","title":"About Me"}]
