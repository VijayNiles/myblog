      <title>Building Production-Ready LLM Applications</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models have transformed how we think about AI applications, but building production-ready systems requires more than just an API call to GPT-4. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share some lessons learned from deploying LLM-powered applications at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-reality-check&#34;&gt;The Reality Check&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re prototyping, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get excited about the capabilities of modern LLMs. But production is a different beast. You need to think about latency, cost, reliability, and security—all while maintaining the quality that makes these models useful in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Every Engineer Should Write</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to think writing was something you did &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you figured things out. Turns out, writing is how you figure things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-thinking-tool&#34;&gt;The Thinking Tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you sit down to explain a concept in writing, you quickly discover what you actually understand versus what you just thought you understood. The gaps become obvious. The fuzzy parts demand clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why some of the best engineers I know are also prolific writers. They&amp;rsquo;re not necessarily better communicators—they&amp;rsquo;re better thinkers, and writing is their thinking tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
