I used to think writing was something you did *after* you figured things out. Turns out, writing is how you figure things out.

## The Thinking Tool

When you sit down to explain a concept in writing, you quickly discover what you actually understand versus what you just thought you understood. The gaps become obvious. The fuzzy parts demand clarity.

This is why some of the best engineers I know are also prolific writers. They're not necessarily better communicators—they're better thinkers, and writing is their thinking tool.

## The Compounding Returns

Here's what happens when you write consistently:

1. **You learn faster** - Forcing yourself to articulate concepts solidifies your understanding
2. **You build your reputation** - Good writing attracts opportunities
3. **You help others** - Someone struggling with the exact problem you solved will find your post
4. **You create documentation for your future self** - I can't count how many times I've referenced my own blog posts

## Just Start

Don't wait until you're an expert. Write about what you're learning right now. The best time to write about something is when you've just figured it out, while you still remember what it was like not to know.

Your blog doesn't need to be perfect. It just needs to exist.
