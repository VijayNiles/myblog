# Hey, I'm Vijay 👋

I'm a Solutions Architect at AWS who spends my days helping enterprises unlock the potential of AI and machine learning. But really, I'm just someone who gets genuinely excited about solving hard problems and sharing what I learn along the way.

## Why I Write

Writing isn't just a hobby for me—it's my thinking tool. There's something magical about forcing yourself to articulate an idea clearly enough for someone else to understand it. The process of writing exposes the gaps in my knowledge, sharpens my reasoning, and helps me crystallize concepts that otherwise live as fuzzy intuitions in my head.

## Knowledge Should Flow Freely

Tech has always thrived on open knowledge sharing. Someone wrote the blog post that helped you debug that weird AWS error. Someone else created the Stack Overflow answer that saved your weekend. I write because I've been on the receiving end of that generosity countless times, and I want to pay it forward.

Whether it's architecture patterns for generative AI, lessons from building production LLM systems, or just observations about working in tech, I believe in documenting and sharing the journey. We all level up faster when we share what we learn.

## Beyond the Keyboard

When I'm not architecting cloud solutions or experimenting with the latest AI models, you'll find me on hiking trails, geeking out over fountain pens, or diving deep into Reformed theology. I'm a believer that the best engineers are well-rounded humans with curiosity that extends beyond code.

## Let's Connect

I'm always up for connecting with fellow builders, learners, and knowledge sharers. Find me on LinkedIn where I share insights about AI/ML, cloud architecture, and career growth in tech. Whether you want to chat about model context protocols, swap hiking trail recommendations, or debate the merits of different fountain pen nibs, my inbox is open.

Let's build something great together.
